I have a girl dog named Polly, she is a Golden Doodle but has black fur. Her breed is a mix of a Golden Retriever and a Standard Poodle. She is a big dog and my family has had her since she was less than a year old and I was about 5. She is very old for a big dog, she is about 14 years old and has recently gone deaf. Polly has been a huge part of my life and always knows how to brighten up my day.
