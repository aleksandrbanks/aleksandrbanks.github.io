My Father is from New Bedford MA, My mother was from Cincinnati, but she passed away due to esophageal cancer in 2007. Her mother Nora has been a huge part of my life taking over the motherly aspect and I am forever greatful for that. My friends have been a major part of my life influencing me on almost any situation and always being there for me if I need it.
